# Wordpress jquery-googleslides

Fork of the Wordpress jquery-googleslides plugin by Brady Holt
(https://github.com/bradyholt). It is NOT a clone of the original
jquery-googleslides repo since it is not a Wordpress plugin. It is a clone
of the Wordpress CVS repo.

The Wordpress plugin has not been updated in quite a while, so this fork
includes small tweaks to be compatible with the latest versions of Wordpress
and PHP.

## Installation

Clone this project into `wp-content/plugins`. Enable the plugin from the
Wordpress admin console.
